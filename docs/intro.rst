Introduction
============

The main feature okscraper-django adds on top of okscraper is the okscrape management command. You can use it to run scrapers inside your django project. You can optionally pass parameters to your scrapers, change verbosity level and output logs to your database. The logs you output to the database will be available in the admin interface.
